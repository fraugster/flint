# flint

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fraugster/flint.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fraugster/flint)

Slightly stricter linter for the Go programming language.

This code is considered to be work in progress.

### Purpose

The current functionality of flint is focused on imports formatting.  
Irregularities such as grouping or empty spaces are caught:

```
import (
    "os"
    "another"

        "external.com/ooo" // empty space

    "external.com/gsggs // third import group not allowed
```
